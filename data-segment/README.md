## Purpose:
The purpose of this web page is to illustrate how the data-segment is organized and viewed under various options.  This page can also be used effectively for the heap and stack segments.  The views for these 
segments, h \owever, should contain different information.

### Heap View
  * 
### Stack View
  * The frame should be depicted as words not as bytes.
  * The memory vectory should provided overlapping frames
  * The matrix view is less important.


## Components:
  * Data Memory Control: provides the ability to adjust view of memory:
    * alignment
    * word size
    * endianness
    * data formats
  * Data Memory Vector: provides the ability to view memory as an vector of byte
  * Data Memory Array: provides the abililty to view memory as an NxM array of bytes
  * File Control: provides the ability to load (into the view and memory) to save (to file)
  * File Display/Edit: provides the ability to edit the text area
      * In this view, only the .data segment directives should be editable?
